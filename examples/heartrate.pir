This is a program translated from HasChor. There are two locations, AGC and LPF. 
AGC sends two numbers to LPF and then LPF calculates the avergae of these numbers locally and returns.-}


main := 
let LPF.x := LPF.0; in
let LPF.y := LPF.0; in
let AGC.x := AGC.0; in
let AGC.y := AGC.0; in

if LPF.(x != 0)
then LPF[L] ~> AGC;
let LPF.x := [AGC] AGC.x ~> LPF; in
  if AGC.(y != 0)
  then AGC[L] ~> LPF;
  let LPF.y := [AGC] AGC.y ~> LPF; in
  LPF.((x+y)/2)
  else AGC[R] ~> LPF;
  LPF.((x+y)/2)
  else LPF[R] ~> AGC;
  LPF.((x+y)/2)
